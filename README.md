## Team Roster

Deployed site: https://cathyob.github.io/team-roster/

This was created to exercise a webcall and practice a multi-route React app.

The backend is currently a 3rd party API so backend functionality is limited.

A user may visit the home page and either Register or Sign-In.

After Sign-In a user will see a list of players saved to their account.

After Sign-In a user may Add Player.

A player may be deleted.

Some validation was added to inputs e.g. length and type.

### Future Iterations

The plans for future iterations:
* Create new backend with additional functionality
* Add warning modal when user is deleting a player
* Add logout functionality
